# Contributing Cleanup

**Date:** 2025-12-30  
**Type:** Documentation  
**Status:** ✅ Done

## Context

The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file contained a tip about keeping PRs focused and small, which is somewhat redundant with other guidance and doesn't add much value.

## Changes

- Removed the line "Keep PRs focused and small (one logical change)" from the Tips section in `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Rationale

This simplifies the contributing guidelines by removing redundant advice, making the document more concise.

## Testing

- No testing required (documentation-only change)

## Follow-up

None required.
