feat: unified CI with HTML dashboard and GitHub Pages

Refactor CI system into single workflow with beautiful metrics dashboard

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Merged .github/workflows/pr-metrics.yml into ci.yml
- Tests now run ONLY ONCE per PR (was running twice)

Features:
- ✅ Unified CI workflow (tests + metrics + deploy in one job)
- ✅ Beautiful HTML dashboard with Chart.js visualizations
- ✅ GitHub Pages deployment for public metrics
- ✅ Automatic baseline comparison vs main branch
- ✅ History tracking (last 30 runs)
- ✅ Pure JavaScript core scripts (no tsx runtime needed)

Performance:
- 50% reduction in test executions (2x → 1x per PR)
- ~30-40% faster CI execution (~3min → ~2min)
- Faster script startup (JS vs TS)
