# Cursor Module

Module for integrating barducks with Cursor IDE. Handles:
- Copying commands from modules to `.cursor/commands/`
- Merging rules from modules to `.cursor/rules/barducks-rules.md`
- Generating `mcp.json` from module MCP configurations

This module is recommended for Cursor IDE integration, but is not required for all workspaces.
