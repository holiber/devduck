# Evolution Module

Module for making changes to devduck itself.

## Architecture Documentation

All information about devduck architecture, module system, and workspace configuration is documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md` in the project root.

When making changes to devduck architecture:
1. Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` to understand current architecture
2. Plan changes according to architecture principles
3. Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` to reflect changes
4. Ensure backward compatibility when possible
5. Document all architectural changes

See `rules/architecture.md` for detailed guidelines.
