IMPORTANT! When making a PR you must follow the rules in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## Cursor Cloud Agent (barducks 🦆) discipline

If you are a Cursor Cloud Agent working on a task, you MUST follow the strict single-task PR workflow:

- `docs/agent-workflow.md`

This includes (non-exhaustive):

- One task = one branch + one PR
- A single continuously-updated PR status comment (no comment spam) with:
  - `<!-- barducks-agent-status -->`
- A single task doc:
  - `docs/<short-task-name>.md`
- Stage-by-stage commits/pushes after the required checkpoints
